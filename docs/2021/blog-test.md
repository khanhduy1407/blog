Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

## Where does it come from?

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor
at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more
obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered
the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and
1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and
Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory
of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem
Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section
1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced
below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de
Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact
original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation
by H. Rackham.
