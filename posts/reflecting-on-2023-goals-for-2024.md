ðŸŽ† Happy new year 2024 ðŸŽ‰! With 2024 upon us, we would like to take this opportunity to recap what happened in 2023, and discuss what to expect in 2024.

The year 2023 has passed like a vibrant and colorful journey, where I not only faced new challenges but also embarked on building new personal projects with the hope of leaving a lasting impact - WiteJS, DtwoJS, and FamilyJS. In this article, let's together step into the world of creative ideas and accompany me through new goals in 2024: PyLahm, LahmAI, and DD Programming Language.

## Reflecting on 2023 and summarizing the accomplishments.

Throughout the past year, there were goals I set and successfully achieved, and of course, there were a few goals that remained unfinished or were not as well-executed. This is not only a result of effort but also a process of learning and gaining experience from failures. The year 2023 opened up new opportunities, and I acquired a wealth of knowledge, patience, creative thinking skills, and teamwork abilities. This development stems not only from successes but also from invaluable advice from mentors and the support of family, teachers, and friends.

Let's review the personal projects I accomplished in 2023. I won't list all the small projects and supporting libraries here; instead, I'll focus on the main projects:

### WiteJS v4

Wite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

| First Build Speed                             |  1.5s   |          1.2s          |                0.9s                 |
| Subsequent Build Speed                        |  0.2s   |          0.1s          |                0.05s                |
| SSR Support                                   |  Basic  |        Advanced        |               Stable                |
| New Features for Rollup                       |  None   |     Some Features      |            Many Features            |
| Support for New File Formats                  |  None   | WebAssembly, .kdu.d.ts | WebAssembly, .kdu.d.ts, .mjs, .wasm |
| Compatibility with Other Tools and Frameworks |  Good   |         Better         |                Best                 |
| Stability and Performance                     |  Good   |         Better         |                Best                 |

Above is a basic detailed comparison table among the versions WiteJS v2, v3, and v4. One of the most notable changes is the reduction in package size, improving download and installation times, especially in testing environments for documentation and reuse. Wite 4 also adds support for new frameworks and runtimes, including Solid, SSR, and library starters, expanding Wite's versatility for various types of web applications.

Furthermore, Wite 4 enhances the performance of Hot Module Replacement (HMR). HMR allows developers to modify the application code without having to reload the page. In Wite 4, HMR operates faster and more reliably, even for large applications. Lastly, Wite 4 introduces several other minor improvements, such as support for JavaScript path expressions in the configuration file, enhanced compatibility with plugins, and support for new languages.

### DtwoJS

Dtwo's goal is to make web development intuitive and performant with a great Developer Experience in mind.

Dtwo is a free and open-source framework with an intuitive and extendable way to create type-safe, performant and production-grade full-stack web applications and websites with Kdu.js. We made everything so you can start writing `.kdu` files from the beginning while enjoying hot module replacement in development and a performant application in production with server-side rendering by default.

Dtwo has no vendor lock-in, allowing you to deploy your application everywhere, even on the edge.

### FamilyJS, RindoJS, JigraJS

Formerly known as NavifyJS, the decision to rename it to FamilyJS aligns with its nature, as it is user-friendly and capable of developing applications once that work across multiple platforms.

**FamilyJS** is an UI toolkit for building performant, high-quality mobile apps using web technologies â€” HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” with integrations for frameworks like React, and Kdu.

**RindoJS** is a compiler that generates Web Components (more specifically, Custom Elements). Rindo combines the best concepts of the most popular frameworks into a simple build-time tool. Rindo uses TypeScript, JSX, and CSS to create standards-compliant Web Components that can be used to craft high quality component libraries.

And **JigraJS** is a cross-platform native runtime that makes it easy to build performant mobile applications that run natively on iOS, Android, and more using modern web tooling. Representing the next evolution of Hybrid apps, Jigra creates **Web Native apps**, providing a modern native container approach for teams who want to build web-first without sacrificing full access to native SDKs when they need it.

## Goals for 2024

In the new year of 2024, my goal is to continuously enhance skills and knowledge. I will engage in courses, read books, and seek new learning opportunities to keep progressing. One of my top priorities is to build better relationships and actively contribute to the community. My overarching goal is to improve my English language skills. Additionally, I have other personal projects that I will strive to complete in the year 2024:

### PyLahm & LahmAI

PyLahm is a machine learning (ML) framework based on the Python programming language and the LahmAI library. LahmAI is a ML library used for creating deep neural networks. It's one of the preferred platforms for deep learning research. The framework is built to speed up the process between research prototyping and deployment.

### DD Programming Language

DD is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining **robust**, **optimal**, and **reusable** software.

- **Robust**: Behavior is correct even for edge cases such as out of memory.
- **Optimal**: Write programs the best way they can behave and perform.
- **Reusable**: The same code works in many environments which have different constraints.
- **Maintainable**: Precisely communicate intent to the compiler and other programmers. The language imposes a low overhead to reading code and is resilient to changing requirements and environments.

_\* Furthermore, I will also provide additional custom libraries to better support the functionality of the projects!_
